# Notes
- Backwards compatibility
  - GOPACS will use Shapeshifter for capacity limit contracts. This means that the distribution grid operators in the Netherlands will use Shapeshifter. Capacity limits will be focused at connection level. In near future possibly also at portfolio level.
  - GOPACS is a hub between the grid operators and the trading companies. This is a variation between the direct bilateral message protocol Shapeshifter is designed for.
